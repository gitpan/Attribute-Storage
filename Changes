        [CHANGES]
         * Added apply_subattrs and find_subs_with_attr; useful copies from

0.08    BUGFIXES:
         * Ensure that dynamic late application using attributes->import
           works, even from other packages
         * Ensure that multi-line attribute definitions work

0.05    CHANGES:
         * Use XSLoader instead of DynaLoader

0.04    BUGFIXES:

           Makefile.PL rather than 'traditional'

0.03    CHANGES:
         * Use Magic to implement value storage behind CVs so that destruction
           correctly frees old values on code reload or dropping anonymous
           subs
